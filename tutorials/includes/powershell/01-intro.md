This tutorial teaches you how to build a PowerShell script that uses the Microsoft Graph API to access data on behalf of a user.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to use Microsoft Graph to access data using app-only authentication, see this [app-only authentication tutorial](/graph/tutorials/powershell-app-only).

In this tutorial, you will:

- [Get the signed-in user](/graph/api/user-get)
- [List the user's inbox messages](/graph/api/user-list-messages)
- [Send an email](/graph/api/user-sendmail)

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative to following this tutorial, you can download the completed code through the [quick start](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/quick-start?state=option-powershell) tool, which automates app registration and configuration. The downloaded code works without any modifications required.
>
> You can also download or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-powershell/tree/main/user-auth) and follow the instructions in the README to register an application and configure the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, you should have [PowerShell](/powershell) installed on your development machine. PowerShell 5.1 is the minimum requirement, but PowerShell 7 is recommended.

You should also have either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account. If you don't have a Microsoft account, there are a couple of options to get a free account:

- You can [sign up for a new personal Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/signup?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1454618383&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://mail.live.com/default.aspx&id=64855&cbcxt=mai&bk=1454618383&uiflavor=web&uaid=b213a65b4fdc484382b6622b3ecaa547&mkt=E-US&lc=1033&lic=1).
- You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.

> [!NOTE]
